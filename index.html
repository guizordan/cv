            In his role, Guilherme worked with Oracle technologies, beginning as
            a Junior Trainee Developer. His primary responsibilities included
            fixing UI bugs using Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery, as well as
            developing new backend features for a web commerce platform using
            Oracle tools and Java.

            >
            <br />

            During this period, Guilherme focused on completing his final paper
            and finishing college, while also expanding his knowledge of new
            technologies and honing his programming skills. He took on freelance
            work, developing hybrid mobile apps with AngularJS and backend
            solutions using Ruby on Rails. To deliver full-stack applications
            for his small client portfolio, he also learned Linux, Bash
            scripting, SQL, Git, and Heroku.

            <br />

            In his role as a Java and JavaScript developer, Guilherme quickly
            demonstrated his expertise and was promoted to front-end tech lead,
            where he designed the front-end architecture for a major
            pharmaceutical network's project using React, Redux, and Material
            UI. He also contributed as a React Native and Node.js engineer,
            building a mobile financial loan application. In this project, he
            provided technical leadership to the front-end team, developing the
            mobile app with React Native and related technologies such as React
            Navigation, Redux, Redux-Saga, and Jest/Enzyme, while also
            implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline. <br />
            <br />
            Following the project’s completion, Guilherme continued as its
            maintainer, handling manual updates to the PostgreSQL database and
            fixing front-end and back-end bugs.

            <br />

            This was Guilherme’s first experience working with an international
            company, where he served as a React Native and Node.js Engineer on a
            healthcare app for hypothyroidism studies. As the project involved
            global collaboration, all communication was conducted in English.
            His key responsibilities included developing the React Native app
            from scratch under the guidance of the tech lead and building Lambda
            functions for the Node.js backend on AWS.
            <br /><br />
            In April 2020, while still with the company, Guilherme was assigned
            to a new project as a third-party contractor at Praxent, where he
            worked as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this role, he utilized
            technologies such as Node.js, React, Microsoft SQL Server, Heroku,
            and GraphQL. This large-scale project required frequent engineering
            meetings and pair programming sessions, where Guilherme built strong
            relationships with both QA and fellow developers. His contributions
            earned him a spot in the top 10% of engineers within the company,
            marking significant achievements in his career.
            <br /><br />
            Following the conclusion of the Praxent project, which transitioned
            to the customer’s in-house team, Guilherme was allocated to a
            startup project. As the sole tech lead and frontend engineer on a
            4-person team, he led the React development for a catering software
            solution, using Material UI, flow typings, Redux Thunk, and Jest
            with Enzyme. One of his major accomplishments was significantly
            improving the performance of the Kanban board’s filtering and
            sorting functions, which were built using the React Drag and Drop
            library.

            <br />

            As a Front-End Accessibility Engineer, Guilherme worked at Adobe
            Workfront under a partner company’s umbrella. His primary
            responsibilities involved adding new features to the 20-year-old
            Workfront application, focusing on remediating accessibility by
            implementing keyboard navigation and screen reader support. In
            addition to his software engineering duties, Guilherme also acted as
            a QA engineer, ensuring that each merge request met strict quality
            standards through code reviews and manual testing between engineers.
            <br /><br />
            He gained valuable experience with architectural solutions such as
            Microfrontends, versioning of Node packages, and building
            Microfrontends using Rollup, with build testing via Yalc. Guilherme
            also resolved CI/CD pipeline issues and regularly worked with
            technologies like Jest, React Testing Library, TypeScript, and
            Styled Components.

            In this role, Guilherme single-handedly developed and maintained an
            automated GitHub application using Fastify, Jest, and the GitHub
            GraphQL API. As the sole engineer on the team, he was responsible
            for the full lifecycle of the application, including deploying and
            managing it in the GCP cloud.

            <br />

            At Softwaremind, Guilherme worked on a large legacy project for a
            key client, where security considerations necessitated upgrading all
            the libraries used in the project. His main responsibilities
            included upgrading the server node versions from 6 to 18 using Bash
            scripting and Docker containers. He also migrated the versions of
            the two databases utilized in the project—SQL Server and
            MongoDB—along with their respective drivers. Additionally, he
            upgraded all front-end and back-end libraries while ensuring that
            everything continued to function properly. He managed the CI/CD
            process for the entire upgrade using Jenkins and GitHub.
            <br /><br />
            Currently, Guilherme continues to work at Softwaremind with a new
            client, serving as a senior full-stack developer on a project that
            utilizes Microsoft OCR AI technologies, Azure Functions in C#,
            CosmosDB, and Storage Queues. The frontend is built using React.
