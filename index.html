          <h1>Job Experience</h1>

          <p>
            I started my professional journey as a salesperson and technician in
            a computer store. During this period, I learned how to sell, install
            networks, build and give maintanence to personal and enterprise
            computers. <br />
            <small><strong>(from 10/2011 to 04/2014)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            Later, I had the opportunity to work with Oracle technologies at
            <a href="https://compass.uol/">Compass</a> where I started my career
            as a software engineer. I started as a Junior Trainee Developer. The
            tools we were using at the time were Oracle Commerce, Oracle
            Database, Java, JavaScript and jQuery. My main assignments there
            were to fix UI and backend bugs on the eCommerce platform we were
            giving support. <br />
            <small><strong>(from 04/2014 to 09/2015)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            Later that year, my main focus turned to delivering the final paper
            and finishing college. I was able, then, to study new technologies
            and improve my programming skills.
            <br />
            I also did freelance work by developing hybrid mobile apps with
            AngularJS and backend with Ruby on Rails. I learned Linux, bash
            script, SQL, git and heroku to develop and deliver front-to-back
            complete applications to my small portfolio of clients.
            <small><strong>(from 10/2015 to 01/2018)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            In February of 2018 I joined
            <a href="http://www.meta.com.br/">Meta</a> as a Java and JavaScript
            developer. But, after demonstrating my skills, I was quickly
            assigned to act as a front-end tech lead and designed the front-end
            project architecture for an important pharmaceutical network company
            using React, Redux and Material UI. <br />
            <small><strong>(from 02/2018 to 02/2019)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            In April 2019, still working at
            <a href="http://www.meta.com.br/">Meta</a>, and after the previous
            project ended, I was transferred to a new one to build a mobile
            financial loan application, I participated as a React Native and
            Node.js Engineer. My role was to give support to our team acting as
            a front-end tech lead to develop the mobile application using React
            Native and its surronding technologies such as React Navigation,
            Redux, Redux Saga and Jest/Enzyme. This project also had a well
            though CI/CD pipeline.
            <br />
            Upon completion of the project, I followed as its maintainer. My
            main role was to give support to any needed manual changes to the
            PostgreSQL database and also fixed bugs o our application's both
            front and back-ends <br />
            By December of 2019 the project had handled more than 1 million BRL
            in financial loans.<br />
            <small><strong>(from 04/2019 to 12/2019)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            In December of 2019, I joined the international team at
            <a href="https://www.bairesdev.com/">Bairesdev</a> to work as a
            React Native and Node.js Engineer on a app of healthcare
            hypothyroidism studies program. As this was an international
            project, all communication was in English. My main responsibilities
            there were to develop the React Native app from scratch following
            our tech lead guidance and also develop lambda functions at our
            amazon cloud Node.js backend.
            <small><strong>(from 12/2019 to 04/2020)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            In April 2020, while still at
            <a href="https://www.bairesdev.com/">Bairesdev</a> I was assigned to
            a new project as a third party contractor at
            <a href="https://praxent.com/">Praxent</a>. In that role, I worked
            as a Full Stack Web developer, using technologies such as Node.js,
            React, Microsoft SQL Server, Heroku and GraphQL. This was a huge project
            that often needed engineering meetings and pair programming. I had a
            great relationship with all QA and programmers there. This project
            was full of achievements, since then, I became one of the top 10%
            Engineers at BairesDev.
            <br />
            <small><strong>(from 04/2020 to 02/2021)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            After the project at Praxent was transferred to the customer's
            in-house development, I was allocated to a small startup project as
            the only tech lead/frontend engineer of a 4-person team to work on
            React development for a catering software solution. The project used
            Material UI, flow typings, Redux Thunk and Jest with Enzyme. There,
            my main achievement was to greatly improve the filter and sorting
            performance of the kanban board present within the application. It
            was developed using the React Drag and Drop library.
            <br />
            <small><strong>(from 02/2021 to 06/2021)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            Althought my participation on the last project was a success, I was
            presented with an amazing opportunity to join Adobe Workfront's team
            - still under BairesDev umbrella - and then, decided accept The Front-End Accessibility Engineer role at
            <a href="https://www.workfront.com/integrations/adobe"
              >Adobe Workfront</a
            >. My responsabilities as an Accessibility Engineer were to add a11y
            features to the 20 years old ongoing Workfront application. We were
            remediating the tool by adding Keyboard and Screen Reader support to
            it. I, as a software engineer also play the QA engineer role, since
            our merge requests must fullfil certain requirements and one
            software engineer reviews the whole work of the other (including
            manual testing). I've obtained experience with architecture
            solutions like Microfrontends, versioning of node packages and
            building these microfrontends using roll-up and testing their build
            using yalc. I also fix CI/CD pipeline issues and worked daily with
            tools like Jest, React Testing Library, Typescript and Styled
            components.

            My last position was as a backend engineer at
            <a href="https://www.nearform.com/"
              >Nearform</a
            >. I've developed an automated Github application with Fastify, Jest and the Github GraphQL API.
            I was the only engineer on the team, so my responsibilities were to maintain this app and deploy it to the GCP cloud.
