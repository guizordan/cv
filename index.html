          <h1>Job Experience</h1>

          <p>
            I started my professional life as a salesperson and technician in a
            computer store. <br />
            <small><strong>(from 10/2011 to 04/2014)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            Later, I had the opportunity to work with Oracle products at
            <a href="https://compass.uol/">Compass</a> where I started my career
            as a JavaScript and Java developer. <br />
            <small><strong>(from 04/2014 to 09/2015)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            I did freelance work for a while, developing hybrid mobile apps with
            AngularJS and backends with Ruby on Rails. <br />
            This is also the period I used to focus and improve my technical and
            programming skills, I invested this time in college to deliver my
            final paper. <br />
            <small><strong>(from 10/2015 to 01/2018)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            In February of 2018 I joined
            <a href="http://www.meta.com.br/">Meta</a> as a Java and JavaScript
            developer for a large client of the pharmacy chain in Brazil. I was
            responsible for the front-end project architecture in React and
            Redux.<br />
            <small><strong>(from 02/2018 to 02/2019)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            In April 2019, I was transferred to a new project to build a mobile
            financial loan application, I participated as a React Native and
            Node JS Engineer. <br />
            Upon completion of the project, I followed as its maintainer and
            supporter. <br />
            By December of 2019 the project had handled more than 1 million BRL
            in financial loans.<br />
            <small><strong>(from 04/2019 to 12/2019)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            In December of 2019, I joined the international team at
            <a href="https://www.bairesdev.com/">Bairesdev</a> to work as a
            React Native and Node JS Engineer on a healthcare hypothyroidism
            studies program. As this is an international project, all
            communication was in English.
            <br />
            Unfortunately, due to the onset of the pandemic, the project had to
            be aborted early.<br />
            <small><strong>(from 12/2019 to 04/2020)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            In April 2020, while still at
            <a href="https://www.bairesdev.com/">Bairesdev</a> I was assigned to
            a new project at <a href="https://praxent.com/">Praxent</a> to work
            as a Full Stack Node + React + Microsoft SQL Server + GraphQL
            Software Engineer on a rodeo sales project. This project was full of
            achievements and leveraged me to be one of the top 10% Engineers in
            the company.
            <br />
            <small><strong>(from 04/2020 to 02/2021)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            After the project at Praxent was transferred to the customer's
            in-house development, I was allocated to a small startup project as
            the only tech lead/frontend engineer of a 4-person team to work on
            React development for a catering software solution.
            <br />
            <small><strong>(from 02/2021 to 06/2021)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            Althought I was having huge success on the last project, I was
            presented with an amazing opportunity to join Adobe Workfront's team
            - still under BairesDev umbrella - I decided to accept it. My
            current role is as a Front-End Accessibility Engineer at
            <a href="https://www.workfront.com/integrations/adobe"
              >Adobe Workfront</a
            >.
            <br />
            <small><strong>(from 06/2021 to Present)</strong></small>
          </p>

          <p>
            In the past years, I've been studying new tech, clean code, finances
            and personal growth. I like to attend IT events, courses and also
            participated in two editions of Google's Startup Weekend.
