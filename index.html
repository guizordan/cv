            <br />

            In his role, Guilherme worked with Oracle technologies, beginning as
            a Junior Trainee Developer. His primary responsibilities included
            fixing UI bugs using Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery, as well as
            developing new backend features for a web commerce platform using
            Oracle Commerce and Java.

              ></small
            >
            <br />

            During this period, Guilherme focused on completing his final paper
            and finishing college, while also expanding his knowledge of new
            technologies and honing his programming skills. He took on freelance
            work, developing hybrid mobile apps with AngularJS and backend
            solutions using Ruby on Rails. To deliver full-stack applications
            for his small client portfolio, he also learned Linux, Bash
            scripting, SQL, Git, and Heroku.
          </p>

            >
            <br />

            In his role as a Java and JavaScript developer, Guilherme quickly
            demonstrated his expertise and was promoted to front-end tech lead,
            where he designed the front-end architecture for a major
            pharmaceutical network's project using React, Redux, and Material
            UI.
            <br /><br />

            Guilherme contributed to a Ruby on Rails project that powered a
            logistics solution by integrating with multiple third-party APIs to
            gather and process critical data, such as shipment tracking,
            inventory updates, and route optimization. He implemented RESTful
            services using Faraday for API communication and deployed and
            managed the application on Heroku, ensuring a robust and scalable
            system.
            <br /><br />

            He also contributed as a React Native and Node.js engineer, building
            a mobile financial loan application that facilitated over 4 million
            USD in loans. In this project, he provided technical leadership to
            the front-end team, developing the mobile app with React Native and
            related technologies such as React Navigation, Redux, Redux-Saga,
            and Jest/Enzyme, while also implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline.
            <br /><br />

            Following the project’s completion, Guilherme continued as its
            maintainer, handling optimizations to the PostgreSQL database and
            fixing front-end and back-end bugs.

            <br />

            This was Guilherme’s first experience working with an international
            company, where he served as a React Native and Node.js Engineer on a
            healthcare app for hypothyroidism studies. As the project involved
            global collaboration, all communication was conducted in English.
            His key responsibilities included developing the React Native app
            from scratch under the guidance of the tech lead and building Lambda
            functions for the Node.js backend on AWS.

            <br /><br />
            In April 2020, while still with the company, Guilherme was assigned
            to a new project as a third-party contractor at Praxent, where he
            worked as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this role, he utilized
            technologies such as Node.js, React, Microsoft SQL Server, Heroku,
            and GraphQL. This large-scale project required frequent engineering
            meetings and pair programming sessions, where Guilherme built strong
            relationships with both QA and fellow developers. His contributions
            earned him a spot in the top 10% of engineers within the company,
            marking significant achievements in his career.

            <br /><br />
            Following the conclusion of the Praxent project, which transitioned
            to the customer’s in-house team, Guilherme was allocated to a
            startup project. As the sole tech lead and backend engineer on a
            4-person team, he led the development of the backend for a catering
            software solution using Ruby on Rails, with Sidekiq for background
            job processing, Redis for caching and job queues, and MySQL as the
            database. One of his major accomplishments was significantly
            improving the performance of the Kanban board’s filtering and
            sorting functions through efficient database queries and optimized
            background job handling.

            <br />

            As a Front-End Accessibility Engineer, Guilherme worked at Adobe
            Workfront under a partner company’s umbrella. His primary
            responsibilities involved adding new features to the 20-year-old
            Workfront application, focusing on remediating accessibility by
            implementing keyboard navigation and screen reader support. In
            addition to his software engineering duties, Guilherme also acted as
            a QA engineer, ensuring that each merge request met strict quality
            standards through code reviews and manual testing between engineers.
            <br /><br />

            He gained valuable experience with architectural solutions such as
            Microfrontends, versioning of Node packages, and building
            Microfrontends using Rollup, with build testing via Yalc. Guilherme
            also resolved CI/CD pipeline issues and regularly worked with
            technologies like Jest, React Testing Library, TypeScript, and
            Styled Components.

            In this role, Guilherme single-handedly developed and maintained an
            automated GitHub application using Fastify, Jest, and the GitHub
            GraphQL API. As the sole engineer on the team, he was responsible
            for the full lifecycle of the application, including deploying and
            managing it in the GCP cloud.

            At Softwaremind, Guilherme worked on a large legacy project for a
            key client, where security considerations necessitated upgrading all
            the libraries used in the project. His main responsibilities
            included upgrading the server node versions from 6 to 18 using Bash
            scripting and Docker containers. He also migrated the versions of
            the two databases utilized in the project—SQL Server and
            MongoDB—along with their respective drivers. Additionally, he
            upgraded all front-end and back-end libraries while ensuring that
            everything continued to function properly. He managed the CI/CD
            process for the entire upgrade using Jenkins and GitHub.
            <br /><br />

            Currently, Guilherme is working at Softwaremind as a Senior
            Full-Stack Developer on a project for a new client. In this role, he
            is responsible for both backend and frontend development. The
            project leverages Microsoft OCR AI technologies to extract text and
            data from scanned documents, with backend services powered by Azure
            Functions written in C#. The application uses CosmosDB for scalable,
            distributed data storage and Storage Queues for managing
            asynchronous tasks and communication between services. On the
            frontend, React. Guilherme also plays a key role in architecting the
            integration between the OCR system, the data storage solution, and
            the frontend interface, contributing to both the performance and
            scalability of the overall application.
