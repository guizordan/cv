        <h1>Job Experience</h1>

        <p>My professional life started when I was working with sales and computer maintance in a computer shop named Dark's Inform√°tica. <br> <small><strong>(from 10/2011 to 04/2014)</strong></small>.</p>

        <p>Later, I had the opportunity to work with corporational projects in a company named <a
            href="http://www.compasso.com.br/">Compasso</a> where I started my carreer as a
          programmer with JavaScript and Java (Oracle Commerce). <br>
          <small><strong>(from 04/2014 to 09/2015)</strong></small></p>

        <p>Later on, I did freelance work during 6 months, working mostly with PHP,
          Wordpress and hybrid mobile applications <br> <small><strong>(from 10/2015 to 06/2016)</strong></small></p>

        <p>After that, I joined a startup focused on the real estate market called <a href="https://bider.com.br/">Bider</a>.
          I worked on the website's frontend with AngularJS and in the backend with Ruby on Rails. <br>
          <small><strong>(from 06/2016 to 04/2017)</strong></small></p>

        <p>In February 2018 I integrated the team at <a href="http://www.meta.com.br/">Meta</a> working as a Java and
          JavaScript developer with the application reports for a pharmacy network</p>

        <p>In September 2018, at Meta we've started a new project for the pharmacy network. This one would be a
          precification system, focusing on manipulating contracts and trade. <br>
          I was responsible of choosing and architecturing the front-end project in React.<br>
          <small><strong>(from 02/2018 to 02/2019)</strong></small>
        </p>

        <p>In April 2019, I worked with Lebes's Store financial loan mobile application, I participated as a React Native and Node JS developer. <br>
          After the project finished, I followed as its maintainer and supporter. <br>
          By December of 2019 the project had had moved a significant amount of financial loans.<br>
          <small><strong>(from 04/2019 to 12/2019)</strong></small>
        </p>

        <p>In December of 2019, I integrated the international team at <a href="https://www.bairesdev.com/">Bairesdev</a> working as a React Native and Node JS developer on a hipotireoidism health program. <br>
        As it is an international project, all communication was in English. <br>
        Unfortunately due to the start of the pandemic, the project had to be aborted early.<br>
          <small><strong>(from 12/2019 to 04/2020)</strong></small>
        </p>

        <p>In April of 2020, still at <a href="https://www.bairesdev.com/">Bairesdev</a> I was allocated to a new project at <a href="https://praxent.com/">Praxent</a> to work as a Full Stack Node + React + Microsoft SQL Server and GraphQL Software Engineer on a rodeo sales project. This project was full of achievements and leveraged me to be a top 10% developer within the company. <br>
         <br>
          <small><strong>(from 04/2020 to 02/2021)</strong></small>
        </p>

        <p>After the project at Praxent was moved to the final clients' in-house development, I was allocated to a small startup's project as the only tech lead/frontend engineer of a 4 people team to work with React development for a catering software solution.
          <br>
           <small><strong>(from 02/2021 to 06/2021)</strong></small>
         </p>

        <p>Althought I was having huge success on the last project, I received an awesome opportunity to join Adobe Workfront's team - still under BairesDev umbrella - I decided to take it. My current role is of an Frontend Accessibility Engineer for Adobe Workfront. And the experience has been great, so far.
          <br>
           <small><strong>(from 06/2021 to Present)</strong></small>
         </p>

        <p>In the past years, I've been studying JavaScript, Clean Code, finances and personal growth. I like to attend IT events, courses and also participated in two editions of Google's Startup Weekend.</p>

          <h1>Most used Technologies</h1>

          <p>In the beggining I started programming mostly with JavaScript and front-end solutions, and that continued
            throughout my career <br>
            Since then, I became very familiar with JavaScript: Node JS, Vue.JS, TypeScript, GraphQL, React JS and React Native. <br>
            <small><strong>(7 years)</strong></small></p>

          <p>
            I have experience in Ruby <small><strong>(2 years)</strong></small>. <br>
            I have experience in Java <small><strong>(2 years)</strong></small>. <br>
            I have experience in SQL <small><strong>(3 years)</strong></small>. <br>
            I've got a little bit of experience with Python and PHP as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            I take clean code and the chosen design pattern as keys for a project's success and long-term maintenance.<br>
            Team communication and collaboration are also crucial for achieving positive results.
          </p>

          <p>I like to code on Linux or MacOS. mainly on these 2 distros: Manjaro (Arch) and Ubuntu (Debian) <br>
            I also have got great experience with Git, the terminal and bash script.</p>

            <small><strong>(2013/1st - 2017/2nd)</strong></small> <br>
            I like reading and taking online courses about various subjects. From tech courses, to personal development, productivity and financial markets.<br>
